# Codex Summary

Updated AI phase documentation to align with VibeForge's current FastAPI-based Local UI API and safety-focused workflows.

## Changes
- Tailored requirements to emphasize structured questionnaires, workspace isolation, and provider-agnostic model usage.
- Documented architecture with Mermaid diagram showing UI → API → session coordinator → workspace/model interactions, plus component responsibilities.
- Expanded implementation guidance for project layout, setup commands, core modules, and security/performance practices.
- Refined deployment strategy for local-first runs with future containerized targets, environment handling, secrets, and rollback steps.
- Defined monitoring metrics, logging strategy, and incident playbook anchored to session, patch, and model behaviors.
- Clarified testing objectives and scenarios covering session lifecycle, workspace safety, and planned UI/E2E coverage.
- Updated architecture index to point to diagrams, schemas, configs, and AI phase docs for VF-linked changes.
