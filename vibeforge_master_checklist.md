# VibeForge Master Checklist




## MVP Workflow Vocabulary (Vision Context)

This section is **not** a task list. It is shared vocabulary describing the intended **VibeForge MVP workflow** so agents can generate plans/tasks with the right mental model.

### High-level promise
VibeForge turns **structured-only user choices** into a **runnable local app** using a **safe, gated, test-driven factory loop**. Users never provide free-text app descriptions; they influence outcomes via curated options, budgets, and “vibe” controls.

### The canonical artifacts
Agents should think in terms of these stable artifacts (each persisted per session):
- **IntentProfile**: the user’s questionnaire answers (strictly structured, no free text).
- **BuildSpec**: deterministic contract derived from IntentProfile (stack preset, seed/twists, budgets, policies, acceptance criteria).
- **Concept**: human-readable concept doc + structured concept data aligned to BuildSpec constraints.
- **TaskGraph**: a DAG plan (tasks + dependencies + constraints + verification steps).
- **AgentResult**: a standard agent output (unified diff + proposed commands + structured notes).
- **RunSummary**: what was built + how to run + what verified + limitations.

### Session phases (mental model)
A session progresses through phases with strict guards; “wrong phase” calls must be rejected consistently:
1) **SESSION_START** → create session + workspace + initial artifacts
2) **QUESTIONNAIRE** → serve next question → accept answer → repeat → finalize IntentProfile
3) **SPEC_BUILD** → BuildSpec from IntentProfile (deterministic)
4) **IDEA** → generate Concept (seeded creativity within constraints)
5) **PLAN_REVIEW** → generate TaskGraph → gates → show plan summary → approve/reject
6) **EXECUTION** → iterate tasks: dispatch → gate → apply → verify → mark done/failed
7) **VERIFICATION** → final global verification (build/test/smoke)
8) **COMPLETE** or **FAILED/ABORTED** → produce RunSummary + preserve artifacts/logs

*(Exact enum names may differ; the behavior above is the contract.)*

### “Gates everywhere” principle
Before any risky action, the system must gate it. Gates are small policy checks that return **ok / warn / block**, optionally with **multiple-choice clarifications**.
Common gate categories:
- **Feasibility**: scope budgets, diff size limits, unrealistic plans
- **Risk/Policy**: command allowlists, network rule, forbidden patterns
- **Diff/Command validation**: max files/lines, path constraints, forbidden content
- **Plan gates**: block unsafe TaskGraphs before execution starts

**Rule:** Nothing writes outside the session workspace. Nothing runs outside allowlisted command families.

### Execution loop (the “factory engine”)
Execution is intentionally boring and deterministic:
- Pick next ready task from TaskGraph (DAG)
- Route to a role (worker/foreman/fixer/reviewer)
- Agent produces AgentResult (diff + commands-to-run + notes)
- Gate the AgentResult
- Apply diff to workspace repo (safe patching)
- Run task verification (declared by the task)
- Record artifacts + events
- On failure: bounded fix-loop with escalation rules

### Clarifications (structured, never free text)
When gates or agents need more info, they must return **multiple-choice questions**. The UI only allows constrained answers. Clarifications feed back into the coordinator and the next agent step.

### Determinism and reproducibility
Randomness is controlled:
- BuildSpec includes a **seed** (derived deterministically from IntentProfile)
- “Twist cards” are chosen from allowlists and recorded
- Key decisions/config hashes are persisted so runs can be replayed for debugging

### What “done” means for MVP runs
A successful run produces:
- A workspace repo that builds and tests (at least build+test; smoke if available)
- Clear run instructions
- A coherent summary
- An artifact trail and event log sufficient to debug failures

### Planning and execution discipline (Work Packages)
Agents should execute work via **Work Packages (WPs)**:
- WPs are small bundles of VF tasks used for iterative progress (plan → implement → verify → update docs → check off).
- The master checklist remains canonical for “what exists” and “what done means.”
- Planning docs under `docs/ai/planning/` should reference VF IDs and verification commands.

Use the checkboxes below as a living backlog. Mark tasks complete by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.


## Checklist


### 00 Foundations

- [ ] **VF-001 — Create monorepo structure (apps/core/orchestration/models/runtime/storage/configs/schemas)**
  - Initialize the repository with a clear top-level folder layout that matches the architecture. This keeps UI, core logic, orchestration, model adapters, runtime execution, and persistence cleanly separated from day one.

  - Create the shared domain types used across UI/API/core: session phases, agent roles, gate results, and common error/result envelopes. These are the contracts that prevent coupling and spaghetti.
  - Files: `apps/api/vibeforge_api/models/types.py`, `apps/api/vibeforge_api/models/requests.py`, `apps/api/vibeforge_api/models/responses.py`
  - Verification: Models imported and used in routers; pytest passes

- [ ] **VF-141 — Add a Phase-aware API guard layer (wrong-phase handling)**
  - Centralize “wrong phase” checks so every endpoint returns consistent, user-friendly errors and does not allow illegal calls (e.g., submitting answers after PLAN_REVIEW).

- [ ] **VF-142 — Implement progress model + event emission for every major step**
  - Emit structured progress events for: phase changes, question served, answer accepted, artifact created, task dispatched, diff applied, verification started/completed, and completion. These events power the UI timeline.

- [ ] **VF-143 — Persist phase transitions into the event log**
  - Record all state changes (oldPhase → newPhase + reason) into the EventLog for debugging and replayability.

- [ ] **VF-144 — Implement “artifact checkpoints” for each stage**
  - Store a stable snapshot artifact at the end of each stage: `IntentProfile`, `BuildSpec`, `Concept`, `TaskGraph`, and final `RunSummary`, so the run can be inspected without re-running.

- [ ] **VF-145 — Implement “plan preview” formatting for UI consumption**
  - Convert TaskGraph into a concise plan summary: feature list, task count, verification steps, estimated scope, and key constraints—so user can approve with confidence.

- [ ] **VF-146 — Implement “reject plan → revise concept” loop**
  - If user rejects plan, safely return to IDEA (or PLAN_REVIEW) with a revision strategy: regenerate concept, reduce scope, or adjust stack—without losing session integrity.


## 15 Execution Loop: Verification Gates & Recovery (Sequence)

- [ ] **VF-150 — Implement the per-task execution loop (TaskMaster → Agent → Gate → Apply → Verify)**
  - Build the core loop that schedules the next task, runs an agent to produce an AgentResult, gates it, applies the diff, runs per-task verification, and marks the task done/failed.

- [ ] **VF-151 — Implement RepoContextLoader (task-scoped context selection)**
  - Load a bounded set of relevant files into the agent prompt based on the task’s declared inputs (files-to-read), plus optionally small “supporting context” (project structure, conventions).

- [ ] **VF-152 — Implement AgentResult handling for “needs clarification”**
  - Support the agent returning multiple-choice questions; pause execution, expose questions to UI, accept user choices, then resume with the clarification answers injected into the next agent call.

- [ ] **VF-153 — Implement Diff gate + Apply gate with structured failure reasons**
  - When a diff is blocked (policy/size/paths) or fails to apply, produce a structured failure report that can be routed to FIXER or surfaced to UI.

- [ ] **VF-154 — Implement per-task verification runner (declared in TaskGraph)**
  - Execute the task’s verification steps (e.g., unit tests, lint, build step) after apply. Capture stdout/stderr and store results in artifacts.

- [ ] **VF-155 — Implement automatic “fix loop” policy after verification failure**
  - When verification fails, automatically generate a repair attempt strategy (e.g., create a FIXER task, escalate model, narrow diff limits, or request user choice after N failures).

- [ ] **VF-156 — Add retry counters + escalation rules per task**
  - Track failure count per task and apply escalation: stronger role/model after repeated failures; hard-stop after max retries with a meaningful error summary.

- [ ] **VF-157 — Implement final global verification step-set (end of DAG)**
  - Run a final verification suite (build/test/smoke) after all tasks complete; if it fails, route back into fix loop rather than silently finishing.

- [ ] **VF-158 — Implement “completion summary” assembly from artifacts**
  - Collect and summarize what was built: features, modules, key files changed, how to run, what tests ran, and any known limitations—so user gets a coherent end report.

- [ ] **VF-159 — Add deterministic execution mode (replayable runs)**
  - Ensure the same inputs (IntentProfile + seed) produce the same major decisions (within reason), and record seeds + config hashes so runs can be reproduced for debugging.


## 16 State Machine: MVP Phases (State Diagram)

- [ ] **VF-160 — Encode the session state machine as a formal transition table**
  - Implement an explicit allowed-transition map (fromPhase → toPhase) to prevent accidental illegal transitions as the codebase evolves.

- [ ] **VF-161 — Implement “entry actions” per phase**
  - Define and implement what happens *on entering* each phase (e.g., BUILD_SPEC creates BuildSpec, IDEA generates concept, PLAN_REVIEW generates TaskGraph, EXECUTION starts scheduling).

- [ ] **VF-162 — Implement “exit criteria” per phase**
  - Define and enforce the condition that must be true to exit each phase (e.g., questionnaire complete, concept accepted, plan approved, all tasks done, global verification pass).

- [ ] **VF-163 — Implement FAILED terminal behavior + recovery options**
  - Define what constitutes unrecoverable failure; ensure the system transitions to FAILED cleanly, emits a final error artifact, and offers safe recovery options (restart session, reduce scope, export logs).

- [ ] **VF-164 — Implement controlled “return transitions” for fix loops**
  - Support the state-machine loop VERIFICATION → EXECUTION when final checks fail, with clear guardrails to avoid infinite loops.

- [ ] **VF-165 — Implement session abort and cleanup behavior**
  - Allow user to abort; stop active execution safely, mark session as FAILED (or ABORTED if you add it), and preserve artifacts/logs for inspection.

- [ ] **VF-166 — Add integration tests for phase transitions**
  - Write tests that simulate the main state transitions and assert the system rejects illegal transitions, emits expected events, and persists expected artifacts.

- [ ] **VF-167 — Add “resume session” capability from stored artifacts**
  - Enable restarting the API and resuming an in-progress session from artifacts/event log (initially limited scope), improving robustness and developer ergonomics.
