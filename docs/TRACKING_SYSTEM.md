# VibeForge Tracking System

**Updated:** 2026-01-29

## Overview

VibeForge uses the **Forge Pipeline** for idea-scoped task tracking. This document explains the tracking hierarchy and how to use it.

---

## Tracking Hierarchy

```
IDEA DEFINITION
├── docs/forge/ideas/<IDEA-ID>/inputs/idea.md           ← User's initial idea
├── docs/forge/ideas/<IDEA-ID>/latest/concept_summary.md ← Refined concept
├── docs/forge/ideas/<IDEA-ID>/latest/epics_backlog.md  ← Epic breakdown
├── docs/forge/ideas/<IDEA-ID>/latest/features_backlog.md ← Feature breakdown
└── docs/forge/ideas/<IDEA-ID>/latest/tasks.md          ← ✅ CANONICAL TASK DEFINITIONS

EXECUTION TRACKING
├── docs/forge/ideas/<IDEA-ID>/latest/work_packages.md  ← WP batching + status
├── docs/forge/ideas/<IDEA-ID>/manifest.md              ← Pipeline stage completion
├── docs/forge/ideas/<IDEA-ID>/task_status.md           ← ✅ QUICK STATUS REFERENCE
└── docs/ai/planning/WORK_PACKAGES.md                   ← Global WP log (cross-idea)

CODE TRUTH
└── git log + pytest + npm run build                    ← ✅ ULTIMATE VERIFICATION
```

## File Purposes

### **Canonical Sources (Do Not Edit Manually)**

#### `docs/forge/ideas/<IDEA-ID>/latest/tasks.md`
- **Purpose:** Canonical task definitions (auto-generated by `/task-builder`)
- **Format:** YAML frontmatter + markdown task list
- **Fields:** id, title, description, acceptance_criteria, dependencies, release_target, priority, estimate, tags, target_files
- **Authority:** This is the **single source of truth** for what needs to be built
- **Editing:** Only via Forge pipeline commands (`/task-builder`, `/validate-tasks`)

#### `docs/forge/ideas/<IDEA-ID>/task_status.md`
- **Purpose:** Lightweight, human-readable task completion summary (auto-generated)
- **Format:** Markdown tables + grouped lists
- **Authority:** Generated from `tasks.md` + `work_packages.md` + `manifest.md`
- **Regenerate:** `/task-status <IDEA-ID>`
- **Editing:** Always overwrite (never hand-edit)

### **Execution Tracking (Updated During Work)**

#### `docs/forge/ideas/<IDEA-ID>/latest/work_packages.md`
- **Purpose:** Near-term execution queue (batches tasks into WPs)
- **Format:** Markdown sections per WP
- **Fields:** WP id, Status (Queued/In Progress/Done/Blocked), Tasks included, Goal, Dependencies, Plan Doc, Verify commands
- **Updated by:** `/work-wp` command (auto-updates status)
- **Create WPs:** `/into-wps <IDEA-ID>`

#### `docs/forge/ideas/<IDEA-ID>/manifest.md`
- **Purpose:** Pipeline stage completion index
- **Format:** YAML-style sections (Idea, Concept, Epics, Features, Tasks, Work Packages)
- **Updated by:** Forge pipeline commands + `/work-wp`
- **Authority:** Tracks which pipeline stages are complete

#### `docs/ai/planning/WORK_PACKAGES.md`
- **Purpose:** Global cross-idea WP log (historical record)
- **Format:** Markdown sections per WP (includes completed WPs from all ideas)
- **Authority:** Single file for viewing all WPs across the entire project
- **Note:** Legacy WP-0001 through WP-0052 (pre-Forge); WP-0053+ are idea-scoped

---

## Commands Reference

### Forge Pipeline (Idea Definition)

Generate task definitions from an idea:

```bash
# 1. Normalize the idea
/idea-normalizer <IDEA-ID>

# 2. Summarize the concept
/concept-summarizer <IDEA-ID>

# 3. Extract epics
/epic-extractor <IDEA-ID>

# 4. Extract features
/feature-extractor <IDEA-ID>

# 5. Build tasks (CANONICAL OUTPUT)
/task-builder <IDEA-ID>

# Optional: Validate at each stage
/validate-epics <IDEA-ID>
/validate-features <IDEA-ID>
/validate-tasks <IDEA-ID>
```

### Execution Commands

Execute tasks and track progress:

```bash
# Create work packages from tasks
/into-wps <IDEA-ID>               # Queue all MVP tasks as WPs
/into-wps <IDEA-ID> EPIC-001      # Queue specific epic
/into-wps <IDEA-ID> 5             # Queue first 5 tasks

# Execute work packages
/work-wp <IDEA-ID>                # Run next queued WP
/work-wp <IDEA-ID> WP-0053        # Run specific WP
/work-wp WP-0053                  # Run WP by id (scans for IDEA-ID)

# Generate quick status
/task-status <IDEA-ID>            # Regenerate task_status.md
```

---

## Workflow: From Idea to Completion

### Phase 1: Define the Work

```bash
# Run the full Forge pipeline
/idea-normalizer IDEA-0004-my-new-feature
/concept-summarizer IDEA-0004
/epic-extractor IDEA-0004
/feature-extractor IDEA-0004
/task-builder IDEA-0004

# Result: docs/forge/ideas/IDEA-0004/latest/tasks.md is created
```

### Phase 2: Queue Work Packages

```bash
# Batch MVP tasks into work packages
/into-wps IDEA-0004

# Result: docs/forge/ideas/IDEA-0004/latest/work_packages.md is created
```

### Phase 3: Execute

```bash
# Run work packages one at a time
/work-wp IDEA-0004

# The command will:
# 1. Auto-select the next Queued WP
# 2. Update WP status to "In Progress"
# 3. Execute each task (read canonical definition from tasks.md)
# 4. Run verification
# 5. Update WP status to "Done"
# 6. Update manifest.md
```

### Phase 4: Track Progress

```bash
# Generate quick status reference
/task-status IDEA-0004

# Result: docs/forge/ideas/IDEA-0004/task_status.md shows completion %
```

## Status Icons

Used in `task_status.md` and tracking documents:

- ✅ **Done** — Task completed and verified
- ⏳ **Queued** — Task ready to implement (dependencies met)
- 🔄 **In Progress** — Task currently being worked on
- 📋 **Later** — Deferred to future release (V1, Full, Later)
- 🚫 **Blocked** — Cannot proceed (missing dependency or decision)

---

## Quick Reference: Where to Look

| Question | File to Check |
|---|---|
| What tasks exist for this idea? | `docs/forge/ideas/<IDEA-ID>/latest/tasks.md` |
| Which tasks are complete? | `docs/forge/ideas/<IDEA-ID>/task_status.md` |
| What's the next WP to run? | `docs/forge/ideas/<IDEA-ID>/latest/work_packages.md` |
| What stage is the idea in? | `docs/forge/ideas/<IDEA-ID>/manifest.md` |
| What have I completed historically? | `docs/ai/planning/WORK_PACKAGES.md` |

---

## Legacy Documents

### `vibeforge_master_checklist.md`
- **Status:** ⚠️ LEGACY (marked 2026-01-29)
- **Purpose:** Old VF-task-based tracking system
- **Why retired:** All VF tasks complete; Forge pipeline is the new system
- **Keep for:** Historical reference only

---

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do This

- **Use `/work-wp <IDEA-ID>`** to execute tasks (auto-updates tracking)
- **Run `/task-status <IDEA-ID>`** after completing WPs (regenerates quick view)
- **Trust `tasks.md`** as canonical (never invent task definitions during execution)
- **Keep WPs small** (1-5 tasks per WP for tight feedback loops)
- **Commit often** with WP ids in messages (e.g., `WP-0053 VF-001: remove legacy sessions`)

### ❌ Avoid This

- **Don't hand-edit `task_status.md`** (always regenerate with command)
- **Don't skip verification** (never mark WP "Done" without running verify commands)
- **Don't edit `tasks.md` manually** (use `/task-builder` to regenerate)
- **Don't guess task status** (use explicit completion markers in manifest.md or WP status)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No queued WPs found"

```bash
# Create WPs from tasks
/into-wps <IDEA-ID>
```

### "Task definition not found"

```bash
# Regenerate tasks from features
/task-builder <IDEA-ID>
```

### "Stale task_status.md"

```bash
# Regenerate status file
/task-status <IDEA-ID>
```

### "WORK_PACKAGES.md out of sync"

- The global `WORK_PACKAGES.md` is a historical log
- Idea-scoped `work_packages.md` is the source of truth
- Update global file manually if needed (for cross-project visibility)

---

## Migration from VF Checklist

If you have old VF-task-based work:

1. **Mark `vibeforge_master_checklist.md` as legacy** (add warning header)
2. **Create new idea** (e.g., `IDEA-0005-cleanup-remaining-vf-tasks`)
3. **Run Forge pipeline** to convert VF intent into tasks
4. **Use `/into-wps` + `/work-wp`** for execution

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to tracking:

- **Auto-run `/task-status`** after each `/work-wp` completion
- **Task completion timestamps** in manifest.md
- **WP effort estimates** and velocity tracking
- **Dependency visualization** (task graph + WP graph)
- **Cross-idea dashboards** (aggregate completion across all ideas)

---

**Summary:** Use the Forge pipeline (`/task-builder` → `/into-wps` → `/work-wp`) for structured development. Check `task_status.md` for quick progress visibility. Trust the code as ultimate truth.
