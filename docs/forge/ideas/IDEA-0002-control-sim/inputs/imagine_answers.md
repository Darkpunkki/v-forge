1. internal demo / devs
2. user picks
3. configurable per link
4. roles dont need to have functionality yet
5. what suits the scenario best? to me a tick represents maximum one activity per agent. This is to protect against API calls in loops etc.
6. stubbed initially, then later when user confirms it works introduce real LLM calls. Stubs should clearly indicate that they are stubs in the output they provide
7. all the controls you mentioned. resetting should preserve configuration
8. clean UI matters the most. Ask the user again when the time comes to implement these things
9. in-memory-only session is fine for v1
