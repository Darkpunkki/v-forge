# Imagine Questions - IDEA-0003-vibeforge-is-pivoting-into-a-browser-based-contr

1. Who is the primary target user for /control and /simulation (internal team, client teams, or public users)?
2. What is the MVP scope for /control (must-have features for first release)?
3. How should agents be registered/connected (manual entry, discovery, config file)? What control channel/protocol is expected?
4. What auth/permissions model is required (single-user local, shared team workspace, role-based)?
5. What streaming detail is required in /control (logs only, tool results, live stdout/stderr, final artifacts)?
6. For /simulation, what level of fidelity is needed (simple message passing vs. tool execution emulation)? Any need for stub/record/replay?
7. What inputs should define a simulation scenario (YAML/JSON, UI-driven form, saved templates)?
8. What are explicit non-goals for the initial pivot (features to avoid for now)?
9. How aggressive should deprecation of /session be in this iteration (hide route, remove UI, keep read-only)?
10. What does success look like in 1-3 months (measurable outcomes or demos)?
